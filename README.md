# Golshani-Portfolio
## Description
Personal portfolio created from scratch to showcase skills and talents as well as deployed sample projects.  The purpose of this project aside from putting what I've learned so far into practice, was to create something tangible that can built upon for future employers or clients to view.  
I had the opportunity to learn the capabilities of HTML and CSS as well as areas of limitation or ease of use with the languages.  
During this project, I also discovered the importance of attention to detail and the major difference a slash can make.
